Known bugs in the current version of gEdit:
	  
	* The column indicator isn't entirely accurate.
	  
	* If you launch a plugin that starts a new document, then close
	  the document while it's still writing to it, it will seg fault
	  with a broken pipe error..
	  
	* The plugins are still a little unstable...
	
	* Deleting a line will sometimes make the next line down dissappear,
	  until you highlight it.

	* Changing the MDI Mode may cause problems (strange Segfaults, etc).
	
	* The Line counter has a problem with the first 2 lines of a docuemnt.
